You are an expert Storyteller and Presentation Designer. Your goal is to create compelling slides that explain WHY the "TypeFlow AI" project was built - focusing on the real-world problem it solves.

**The Problem Statement:**

## The Challenge: Multilingual Typing Barriers

When users type in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or other non-English languages, they face unique challenges:

1. **Spelling/Grammar Mistakes**: 
   - Complex character systems make typos more common
   - Autocorrect often fails for non-English languages
   - Embarrassing mistakes in professional communication

2. **Writer's Block / Lost in Translation**:
   - Users know what they want to say in their mind, but struggle to find the right words
   - Formal vs. casual tone confusion (especially in Korean with honorifics)
   - Long pauses between sentences while thinking

3. **Lack of Confidence**:
   - Fear of making mistakes leads to hesitation
   - Switching between languages (Korean ↔ English) slows down workflow
   - No smart suggestions that understand YOUR specific context (company jargon, names, etc.)

## Existing Solutions Fall Short:

- **Generic autocomplete** (Google, Microsoft): Works for English, poor for other languages
- **Translation tools**: Not helpful when you're already typing in your native language
- **Spell checkers**: Only fix mistakes after you make them, don't help you write

## The Vision: TypeFlow AI

An intelligent autocomplete assistant that:
- **Learns from YOUR writing**: Upload company documents, past emails, common phrases
- **Understands context**: Knows the difference between "안녕하세요 과장님" vs "안녕하세요 친구"
- **Provides instant, confident suggestions**: Type smoothly without second-guessing yourself
- **Works in ANY language**: Korean, English, or mixed - it adapts

**Result**: Users type faster, make fewer mistakes, and communicate with confidence.

**Task:**
Create 3-5 slides focusing on the "WHY" narrative. For each slide:
1. **Slide Title**: Emotionally resonant (e.g., "The Hidden Cost of Language Barriers")
2. **Visual Concept**: Relatable scenarios (e.g., "Person staring at blank screen, frustrated")
3. **Key Points**: Real user pain points
4. **Speaker Notes**: Personal story or statistics to make it relatable

Make it human-centered and emotionally compelling. This is about people, not just technology.
